# parameters_influence
We look at different characteristics that can influence the result of the analysis that is found.

In *frequency_cutoff* and *frequency_extra*, We look at how the cutoffs used in the frequencies can influence the data. We look at the high and low frequency cutoff. We also look at the influence of the paramters used in the cutoff, such as the value of the beta parameter in the Kaiser window used for the cutoff filter.

In *PSD_parameters_influence*, we look at the influence on the analysis and the PSD itself of several parmaters that are used to compute it. These are the length of the windows used in Welch's method, the windows, etc.

In *change_waveform_with_parameters*, we look at how the SNR and waveform change with the distance and how it agrees with the theory at the end.

In *PSD_noise*, we look at the influence of the noise characteristics and amplitude on the resulting PSD and the SNR at the end. Moreover, we see what happens when the PSD is computed without the signal present in it.

In *Lenght_signal*, we look at the possibility to detect a BBH event with only a part of the signal present, as well as which parts can be seen as containing the most important information for the merger to be detected.
